    <td>In today's lesson we began to learn about spreadsheets as that is our first topic for Year 9. At first I never knew how complex spreadsheets actually where, and that they are not juts some sheet where you upload your data and that’s it, but there is actually a whole new world just about spreadsheets and what they can do. </td>

    <td>During today’s lesson I personally think that nothing had limited my learning as I was very focused because I was so interested in the topic and I was very eager to try it out myslef therefore I didn’t get distracted at all. </td>

    <td>For next lesson I will make sure I continue what I did this lesson which was staying focused for all of the lesson and really trying to understand and take part in what is going on as I really found it quite fascinating and I honestly never knew how powerful spreadsheets can truly be.
